## üéØ Introduction
R-Type is a horizontally scrolling shooter arcade video game developed and released by Irem in 1987 and the first game in the R-Type series. The player controls a star ship, the R-9 "Arrowhead", in its efforts to destroy the Bydo, a powerful alien race bent on wiping out all of mankind.

The arcade version was distributed by Nintendo in North America; it is the last arcade title Nintendo distributed.
